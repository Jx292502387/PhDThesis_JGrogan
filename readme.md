# Scripts and Data from: The Mechanical Performance of Permanent and Bioabsorbable Metal Stents, J Grogan.

This repository contains some models, scripts and manuscripts from my PhD work.

I am still working on documenting and testing the scripts and subroutines, but am making them available 'as they are' in case they are useful to others.

The models and scripts 'more-or-less' correspond to the ones described in the thesis, but there may be some differences as version control software was not used and I have modified them while tidying.
